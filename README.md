## About

Pitagon Serif is a fresh take on geometric serif styles, contains the Pitagon Design Principles embodied in the
Pitagon Design System (Pi Design System). Pitagon Serif is implemented and inspired by open source font sets like as
IBM Plex Serif and Source Serif. The font set is used in the context of specific use of text such as articles,
books, magazine, etc.

Taking inspiration in Source Serif, the font have heavy asymmetric serifs and arms with inverted angles, which
combine with lowercase designs that share a big x-height, pronounced ascenders, and soft curves of low stroke
contrast, without losing the essence of a design intended for legibility in digital and print media, from headlines
to body text. It blends styles of many great typefaces and is suitable for any design medium. The font set also
conveys well the brand message of Pitagon is "<b><i>BREAKTHROUGH</i></b> the limits".

The font set are made available for public use under the SIL Open Font License.
